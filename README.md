#

# Features to be implemented:
# (01) Generation of random game sets or events
#      Randomly generates the number of ghost pawns, which ranges from 3 - 6.
#      Blue dots would give user random additional power (Enhanced agility / Invisible mode / Sword to kill ghoats from the back)
#      Red dots would give ghosts random additional power (Duplicate itself / half-Invisible mode / shoot fireballs)
#      In level 3, roadblocks will be randomly generated during the game
#
# (02) Data structures for storing game status
#
# (03) Dynamic memory management
#      Users may pause their game and save it anytime. 
#      The game will ask user whether he would like to overwrite the last save or open a new save
#      The score and general abilities of a user will be shown when he read his saved file
#
# (04) File input/output
#      When user press '1', then the game will be paused and a manual of options would appear (Include the save option or restart)
#      When user press '1' again, the game will continue (User will be given an additional 3 seconds to prepare)
#      When user press '2', the game status will be printed out (Level of difficulty, score, and additional power user gained)
#  
# (05) Program codes in multiple files
